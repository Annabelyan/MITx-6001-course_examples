"""In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!
    The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive).
    The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - 
    is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!"""
